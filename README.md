## Tests
On the *tests* folder the files should be able to run by themselves (or have the least amount of dependencies possible), this will make testing easier. On the src *folder* the code should be more compartimentated and reusable (ex: have a graphics library, pins definitions, etc).

## Data
At some point this should be the things you need to store on the SD.
